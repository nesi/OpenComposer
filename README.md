# Open Composer

## Overview

Open Composer is a web application to generate batch job scripts and submit batch jobs for HPC clusters on [Open OnDemand](https://openondemand.org/).

Open Composer is an Open OnDemand app in the "Jobs" category. Unlike Batch Connect interactive apps, Open Composer provides a graphical interface for creating, previewing, editing, and submitting batch job scripts. It supports multiple job schedulers and can be configured for different HPC applications.

- **App type:** Workflow Composer (Jobs category)
- **Latest release:** [`v3.0.0`](https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/OpenComposer/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (see [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md))
- **License:** MIT (see [LICENSE file](https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/OpenComposer/blob/main/LICENSE))
- **Requirements:** Open OnDemand 3.0 or later
- **Supported job schedulers:** Slurm, PBS Pro, PBS Pro/Miyabi, Grid Engine, Fujitsu TCS

## Features

- Graphical web interface for generating and submitting batch job scripts
- Multi-scheduler and multi-cluster support
- Job history page with filtering, status tracking, and job cancellation
- One-by-one job cancellation with an animated in-modal progress bar
- Job history driven by the scheduler itself, so jobs submitted outside Open Composer are listed too
- Optional Job Efficiency report (wall time, CPU, memory, GPU) for finished jobs
- Editable job script preview before submission, with two-way sync between the script and the form
- Configurable application forms via `form.yml`
- Dynamic form widgets with conditional visibility and validation
- Environment-module widgets, including a dropdown that follows another widget's value
- Support for preprocessing steps via submit sections
- Customizable per-application headers and labels
- Path selector widget for file and directory selection
- My Templates — save, manage, reorder, and reuse form configurations
- All Templates page listing every template, including apps hidden from the home page
- "Load or Create a Script from Disk" file browser for editing and resubmitting existing scripts
- Nodes page with dynamic GRES columns auto-discovered from the scheduler
- Navbar search bar for quickly finding templates by name, category, or description
- Optional automatic SSH key provisioning so SSH-based submission needs no password prompt
- Optional OOD-embedded mode — renders inside Open OnDemand's own navbar and footer
- Fully customisable navbar and footer (colours, logo, links)
- Bilingual documentation (English and Japanese)

## Deployment

By default, Open Composer opens in its own tab/window when a user clicks the app tile. This is the standard OOD app behaviour and requires no extra configuration beyond installing the app itself. Alternatively it can run in **OOD-embedded mode**, rendered inside OOD's own navigation bar and footer — see [`ood_integration/`](ood_integration/) and [section 4 of the installation document](https://riken-rccs.github.io/OpenComposer/docs/install.html#ood-integration).

Use `conf.yml.erb.sample` as your starting point — it lists every available setting with its default value:

```sh
cd /var/www/ood/apps/sys/
sudo git clone https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/OpenComposer.git opencomposer
cd opencomposer
sudo cp conf.yml.erb.sample conf.yml.erb
# Edit conf.yml.erb for your site
```

The full navbar is shown by default: the **Selected Templates**, **All Templates**, **History** and **Nodes** links on the left, and the search box, Home Directory link, Shell Access link and Return-to-OnDemand button on the right. Each right-hand item can be hidden (`show_search`, `show_home_directory`, `show_shell_access`, `show_open_ondemand`) and relabelled. A navbar logo appears only once you set `navbar_logo` to an image in `public/`.

## Quick Start

### Standalone app

The following steps assume administrator privileges. If you do not have administrator privileges, see [Section 4. "Installation by general user"](https://riken-rccs.github.io/OpenComposer/docs/install.html#general) in the installation document.

```sh
cd /var/www/ood/apps/sys/
sudo git clone https://github.com/RIKEN-RCCS/OpenComposer.git opencomposer
cd opencomposer
sudo cp conf.yml.erb.sample conf.yml.erb
# Edit conf.yml.erb for your site
```

At minimum, set `apps_dir` and either `scheduler` or a `clusters` block. Every other setting in `conf.yml.erb.sample` is listed with its default value and can be left as-is.

Then reload the OOD dashboard (**Help → Restart Web Server**). Open Composer will appear in the **Jobs** category.

## Troubleshooting

Open Composer writes one line per significant action — `Submit job`, `Cancel job`, `Delete job information`, `Ensure SSH key`, and `Run commands in the check/submit section` — to the per-user PUN log, normally `/var/log/ondemand-nginx/$USER/error.log`. Each line is prefixed `[Open Composer]` and records the scheduler, cluster, and job IDs involved, which makes it the best starting point for a failed submission.

## Known Limitations

- The environment-module widgets (`module_load`, `dependent_module_select`) and the automatic GPU badge require an external JSON module catalogue, configured with `modules_list_url`. With no catalogue configured they are simply inactive.
- Job Efficiency derives its GPU-memory percentage from a hard-coded table of GPU models; other accelerators show raw usage only.
- The `check` section is evaluated with Ruby, and the `submit` section with Bash; neither is sandboxed, so treat `form.yml` files as trusted code.
